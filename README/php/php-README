1: To see php code, please go to:

    <unzipped-folder>/web-app/php/*.php

2: And you can run this file:

    <unzipped-folder>/web-app/index_php.html

3: And you need prepare your database

    please run - myCalendar2.5.0-tables.sql (this is mysql version)
    If you are a myCalendar1.0 user, you may not use the old tables directly
    You need reset the tables, or transfer the old data to new tables
    (Now we did not support that, you have to write the transfer function by yourself)

4: Download extjs 4 from http://www.extjs.com and put it into:

    <unzipped-folder>/web-app/js/extjs

5: Attention

    Please look the file: <u>feyaSoft.home.program.calendar.Viewer.js</u>.
    Currently we hard code the <b>userId = 1</b>. In your real application,
    you need have an ajax call and query the login userId, replace its value
    to this hard code value. However, if you can save userId in your session
    and retrieve it from session later, you do not need change this.

6. You need double check config file: common/CONST_PHP.js, there are several
   paths you need make sure fit your server path.
