        PHP backend, can not copy all in-day events from a day to another;
        Cross-day event layout issue. If the day/week/month views start at sunday, switch view from "Show All" to "Only Weekday" the cross-day event won't right. Modified CalendarLayout.js, DayView.js, MonthView.js, EventHandler.js;
        The floating DIV disappear issue in IE8, modified DayView.js.

        Add a new setting option called 'readOnly'. Set it true will make myCalendar only view the event but can not change anything.
        Add a message hint when cut/copy in MonthView, add a new file "CommentTip.js" for this.
