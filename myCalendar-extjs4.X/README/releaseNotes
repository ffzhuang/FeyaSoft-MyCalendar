        Cross-day event layout issue. If the day/week/month views start at sunday, switch view from "Show All" to "Only Weekday" the cross-day event won't right. Modified CalendarLayout.js, DayView.js, MonthView.js, EventHandler.js;
        The floating DIV disappear issue in IE8, modified DayView.js.
